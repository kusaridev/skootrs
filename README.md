# Skootrs

A CLI tool for creating secure by design/default source repos.

**Note**: This is a POC! Don't use this outside of testing. To get this working it requires you to have a Github Token with appropriate permissions and also you need to modify it to the owner you want the repo to live under. This will change shortly!
