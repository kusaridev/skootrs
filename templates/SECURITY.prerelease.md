# Reporting Security Issues

This project is currently pre-release and should not be used in any non-development (e.g. production) capacity or in any sensitive environments. All security issues, vulnerabilities, etc. should be considered non-sensitive and an issue in the Github repo be opened like any other bug.

This policy will be updated as the project progresses.
